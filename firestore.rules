/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Cayetano Library Hub.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a combination of user-based ownership and role-based access control.
 * - Users have full control over their own profiles under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Administrators, determined by their presence in `/roles_admin/{userId}`, have broad access.
 * - Categories and Materials are generally public for `get` and `list` operations, but write access is restricted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Categories are stored under `/categories/{categoryId}`.
 * - Materials are stored under `/materials/{materialId}`, and include a `categoryId` for efficient querying.
 * - Administrator status is determined by the existence of a document in `/roles_admin/{userId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Public read access is granted for Categories and Materials to facilitate browsing.
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for user profiles.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Material` entity includes `categoryId`, denormalized from `Category`, to enable efficient rules without extra `get()` calls.
